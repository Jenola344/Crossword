- Primary color: Saturated purple (#A020F0), embodying the fusion of technology and mystery, and providing strong contrast in a dark color scheme.
- Background color: Deep, desaturated purple (#262229), establishing a dark theme conducive to extended play sessions, roughly 25% saturation of the primary.
- Accent color: Electric blue (#7DF9FF), analogous to purple but contrasting to catch the user's eye on key interactive elements.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk', a modern sans-serif for headlines and short body text; if longer text is needed, use 'Inter' for the body.
- Use clean, minimalist icons to represent in-game elements and actions.
- Implement a persistent bottom navigation bar for easy access to main sections.
- Use subtle animations to provide feedback on user interactions, like claiming rewards and revealing NFTs.
